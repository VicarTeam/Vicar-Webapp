Blood boost only applies to a single die roll. (Any dice gained by a blood surge are retained for a reroll by willpower). Characters cannot use a blood boost for Willpower or Humanity rehearsals, rehearsals that span multiple scenes, or one-dice battles (p. 296), nor can they use a blood boost unless the narrator allows them.

Vampires can make one Walling check per round to heal Light damage to health. Cure Heavy Damage to Health: To heal Heavy damage, a vampire must wait until the next sunset and then make three Wallung checks in addition to the regular Wallung check upon awakening. This heals one point of Severe Damage, as well as a Paralyzing Injury or similar impairment. A Vampire can only heal one point of Severe Damage per night.
